    <h2> Like many people, I was once born ... </h2>
    <p> And at some point later in life, I fonud myself to be 13 years old, and then soon 14. I was still in my native New York City, unquestionably the greatest city on earth. At this point, I got a job, the first real formative thing I ever did - I taught fishing on the Hudson River for four summers. I still smell like fish. I applied for High School at some point, and attended Stuyvesant High School in New York, which is prestiguous and somehow let me in.

    <h3> The Saga Continues... </h3>
    <p>I kept fishing during the summers, and I learned a bunch of instruments because school was pretty boring. My parents were cool about it though and made me work harder, which I appreciate looking back. Eventually, I applied to a lot of colleges and got into Tufts. When I toured it, everyone was smiling, so I thought it was a good place for me. I was right.

    <h4> But all good bios must come to an end eventually... </h4>
    <p>
        I kept going to Tufts, and met a bunch of people I like, and some I don't. And then I got a job at Dow Jones, which was sweet. Now I'm back, as a senior, and got a job working for athenahealth postgrad.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M67E9mpwBpM" target="_blank"> Everything's coming up millhouse! </a>
